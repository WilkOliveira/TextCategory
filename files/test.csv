quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs5 adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe s software has been criticized for among other things slow performance and frequent crashes marketing ethics adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software third party browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the adobe flash flash update process and for

community especially long term users in may 2013 adobe systems announced plans to end perpetual software licensing for its adobe creative suite creative suite products in favor of a subscription based service model called creative cloud which had been introduced as an alternative licensing model in may 2012 shifting to a software as a service model adobe announced more frequent feature updates to its products and the eschewing of their traditional release cycles customers must pay a monthly subscription fee and if they stop paying they will lose access to the software as well as to the work they saved in proprietary format proprietary file format which is not backward compatible with the creative suite adobe admitted that this is a valid concern in addition they will not be able to retrieve their files from the cloud once the subscription has expired they must have internet connection to download the software and to use the 2 gb of provided storage space or the additionally purchased 20 gb and must validate the license monthly although investors applauded the move the reaction across segments of adobe s user base was swift this shift has been met with mixed reviews by both corporations and independent designers with many people expressing their displeasure on the web and through multiple internet petitions calling upon adobe to continue selling creative software under the perpetual licensing model among these was a change org petition which reached over 30 000 signatures within a few weeks of the announcement currently as of january 21 2014 at 46 300 according to the critics the move to a perpetual rental scheme was highly disruptive to many users and caused an unprecedented loss of trust in adobe as a company and an attendant rise in anxiety among their customers users noted that they have not always wanted nor could they afford to upgrade to the newest versions of the software and the new licensing was essentially forcing them to do this college officials expressed their concern with the new licensing terms worried about rising costs and have asked about switching to alternative products adobe vp of creative solutions responded that they expected a higher degree of this type of reaction from the hobbyist photographic community despite a storm of customer criticism over adobe s move to subscription only pricing the company announced that it would not sell perpetual licenses to its software alongside the subscriptions we understand this is a big change but we are so focused on the vision we shared for creative cloud and

be more accessible and provide better value we believe in fighting piracy of software by making the right software for the right people at the right price the service has been criticized for its price

products according to hold security a firm which discovered 40 gb of adobe s source code on a server of a russian speaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero day attacks hackers already used coldfusion

intel was originally known primarily to engineers and technologists its intel inside advertising campaign of the 1990s made it a household name along with its pentium processors intel was an early developer of static random access memory sram and dynamic random access memory dram memory chips and this represented the majority of its business until 1981 although intel created the world s first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971 it was not until the success of the personal computer pc that this became its primary business during the 1990s intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry during this period intel became the market dominance dominant supplier of microprocessors for pcs and was known for aggressive and sometimes illegal tactics in defense of its market position particularly against advanced micro devices amd as well as a struggle with microsoft for control over the direction of the pc industry the 2013

microprocessor intel 4004 in 1971 by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random access memory chips however increased competition from japanese semiconductor manufacturers had by 1983 dramatically reduced the profitability of this market and the sudden success of the ibm personal computer convinced then ceo andrew grove to shift the company s focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model by the end of the 1980s this decision had proven successful buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to ibm and ibm s competitors within the rapidly growing ibm pc compatible personal computer market intel embarked on a 10 year period of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the pc industry by launching its intel inside marketing campaign in 1989 intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection so that by the end of the 1990s its line of pentium brand pentium processors had become a household name slowing demand and challenges to dominance after 2000 growth in demand for high end microprocessors slowed competitors notably amd intel s largest competitor in its primary x86 x86 architecture market garnered significant market share initially in low end and mid range processors but ultimately across the product range and intel s dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced in the early 2000s then ceo craig barrett businessman craig barrett attempted to diversify the company s business beyond semiconductors but few of these activities were ultimately successful intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation us law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology circuit layouts until the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 a law sought by intel and the semiconductor industry association sia during the late 1980s and 1990s after this law was passed intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the intel 80386 80386 cpu the lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills even if intel lost the suits the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field in 2008 intel had another tick when it introduced the penryn microarchitecture which was 45 nbsp nm later that year intel released a processor with the nehalem microarchitecture nehalem architecture nehalem had positive reviews sale of xscale processor business on june 27 2006

failure of the ultrabook to gain market traction and with pc sales declining in 2013 intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for altera using 14 nm process general manager of intel s custom foundry division sunit rikhi indicated that intel would pursue further such deals in the future this was after poor sales of windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major

income product and market history srams and the microprocessor intel s first products were shift register memory and random access primary storage memory integrated circuits and intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive dynamic random access memory dram static random access memory sram and read only memory rom markets throughout the 1970s concurrently intel engineers marcian hoff federico faggin stanley mazor and masatoshi shima invented intel s first microprocessor originally developed for the japanese company busicom to replace a number of application specific integrated circuit asics in a calculator already produced by busicom the intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on november 15 1971 though the microprocessor did not become the core of intel s business until the mid 1980s note intel is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almost simultaneous invention of the microprocessor from dram to microprocessors in 1983 at the dawn of the personal computer era intel s profits came under increased pressure from japanese memory chip manufacturers and then president andy grove focused the company on microprocessors grove described this transition in the book only the paranoid survive a key element of his plan was the notion then considered radical of becoming the single source for successors to the popular intel 8086 8086 microprocessor until then the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier but grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as zilog and advanced micro devices amd when the pc industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s intel was one of the primary beneficiaries intel x86 processors and the ibm pc image 153056995 5ef8b01016 o jpg right thumb 230px the die integrated circuit die from an intel 8742 an 8 bit microcontroller that

the intel 8008 8008 and the intel 8080 8080 were never major revenue contributors at intel as the next processor the 8086 and its variant the 8088 was completed in 1978 intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed operation crush and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible one design win was the newly created ibm pc division though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time ibm introduced its personal computer in 1981 and it was rapidly successful in 1982 intel created the intel 80286 80286 microprocessor which two years later was used in the ibm pc at compaq the first ibm pc clone manufacturer produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first intel 80386 80386 based system beating ibm and establishing a competitive market for pc compatible systems and setting up intel as a key component supplier in 1975 the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32 bit microprocessor finally released in 1981 as the intel iapx 432 the project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives and it failed in the marketplace intel extended the x86 x86 architecture to 32 bits instead 386 microprocessor during this period andrew grove dramatically redirected the company closing much of its dram business and directing resources to the microprocessor business of perhaps greater importance was his decision to single source the 386 microprocessor prior to this microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production interrupting supplies to customers to mitigate this risk these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply the 8080 and 8086 series microprocessors were produced by several companies notably amd grove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers instead producing it in three geographically distinct factories santa clara california santa clara california hillsboro oregon hillsboro oregon and chandler arizona chandler a suburb of phoenix arizona phoenix arizona he convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery as the success of compaq s deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant cpu choice intel achieved a position of near exclusive dominance as its supplier profits from this funded rapid development of both higher performance chip designs and higher performance manufacturing capabilities propelling intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s 486 pentium and itanium intel introduced the intel 80486 486 microprocessor in 1989 and in 1990 formally established a second design team designing the processors code named p5 and p6 in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken engineers vinod dham and rajeev chandrasekhar member of parliament india were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later intel s signature pentium chip the p5 was earlier known as operation bicycle referring to the cycles of the processor the p5 microarchitecture p5 was introduced in 1993 as the intel pentium brand pentium substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number numbers such as 486 are hard to register as a trademark the p6 followed in 1995 as the pentium pro and improved into the pentium ii in 1997 new architectures were developed alternately in santa clara california and hillsboro oregon the santa clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the x86 x86 architecture codenamed p7 the first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with hewlett packard engineers though intel soon took over primary design responsibility the resulting implementation of the itanium ia 64 64 bit architecture was the itanium finally introduced in june 2001 the itanium s performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations and it failed to compete effectively with x86 64 which was amd s 64 bit extensions to the original x86 architecture intel uses the name intel 64 previously em64t as of 2012 intel continues to develop and deploy the itanium known planning continues into 2014 the hillsboro team designed the pentium 4 willamette willamette processors initially code named p68 which were marketed as the pentium 4 pentium flaw in june 1994 intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating point math subsection of the p5 microarchitecture p5 pentium pentium microprocessor under certain data dependent conditions the low order bits of the result of a floating point division would be incorrect the error could compound in subsequent calculations intel corrected the error in a future chip revision but nonetheless declined to disclose it in october 1994 dr thomas nicely professor of mathematics at lynchburg college independently discovered the software bug bug he contacted intel but received no response on october 30 he posted a message on the internet word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press the bug was easy to replicate a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system consequently many users did not accept intel s statements that the error was minor and not even an erratum during thanksgiving in 1994 the new york times ran a piece by journalist john markoff spotlighting the error intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip quickly putting in place a large end user technical support support organization this resulted in a 500 nbsp million charge against intel s 1994 revenue ironically the pentium flaw incident intel s response to it and the surrounding media coverage propelled intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name dovetailing with an uptick in the intel inside campaign the episode is considered to have been a positive event for intel changing some of its business practices to be more end user focused and generating substantial public awareness while avoiding a lasting negative impression needs page number intel inside and other 1990s programs during this period intel undertook two major supporting programs the first is widely known the 1991 intel inside marketing and branding campaign the idea of ingredient branding was new at the time with only nutrasweet and a few others making attempts to do so this campaign established intel which had been a component supplier little known outside the pc industry as a household name the second program is little known intel s systems group began in the early 1990s manufacturing pc motherboards the main board component of a personal computer and the one into which the processor cpu and memory ram chips are plugged shortly after intel began manufacturing fully configured white box systems for the dozens of pc clone companies that rapidly sprang up at its peak in the mid 1990s intel manufactured over 15 of all pcs making it the third largest supplier at the time during the 1990s intel s intel architecture labs architecture lab ial was responsible for many of the hardware innovations of the personal computer including the peripheral component interconnect pci bus the pci express pcie bus the universal serial bus usb ial s software efforts met with a more mixed fate its video and graphics software was important in the

establishing the barbie product line for the company in 1959 after the release of the barbie doll mattel revolutionized the toy industry with its talking dolls and toys major successes in the 1960s with the talking chatty cathy doll in 1960 and see n say toys in 1965 and the introduction of the hot wheels line in 1968 moved mattel to its position as the number one toymaker in america in 1971 mattel purchased the ringling bros barnum bailey circus for 40 million dollars from irvin feld the feld family bought the circus back in 1982 in the late 1980s mattel was the pal manufacturer chosen by nintendo to make and market the nintendo entertainment system this had followed a failed attempt by nintendo to enter a similar worldwide deal with atari after not securing an agreement with atari even later entering into various lawsuits with that company nintendo decided instead to take a risk and bring their console to north america on their own while cutting pal manufacturing and marketing costs by entering into a deal with mattel mattel had previously made the intellivision in 1979 and had some experience in the video games industry at that time nintendo had in a previous incarnation also been a toy manufacturer and the two companies believed they had much in common after the system became a huge success in america this deal was later considered a mistake in hindsight by nintendo as the mattel version of the console was outsold in the pal regions by the main rival the sega master system nintendo had misjudged mattels enthusiasm for the console which they had not considered a core product in may 1999 at the height of the dot com bubble mattel acquired the learning company for 3 5 nbsp billion in stock or 4 5 times annual sales the learning company had in 1997 accumulated

surface coatings that contain lead surface coatings cannot exceed 06 lead by weight additional recalls were because it was possible that some toys could pose a danger to children due to the use of

its own video game console the intellivision after this failed the company formed a deal with nintendo in order to bring the nintendo entertainment system to the pal regions this was later believed to have been a mistake on nintendo s part as their north american success with the console and its japanese counterpart the famicom was not replicated in the pal regions and they were outsold in these regions by the sega master system this resulted in nintendo being unhappy with the arrangement with mattel and cutting ties with the company nintendo released the gameboy without mattel s involvement

failed to materialize oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice and also settled out of court class action class action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings ellison stated in 1992 that oracle had made an incredible business mistake competition although ibm dominated the mainframe relational database market with its db2 and sql ds database products it delayedentering the market for a relational database on unix and windows operating systems this left the door open for sybase oracle and informix corporation informix and eventually microsoft to dominate mid range and microcomputers around this time oracle technology started to lag technically behind that of sybase in 1990 1993 sybase became the fastest growing database company and the database industry s darling vendor but soon fell victim to its merger mania and to technical issues with system x sybase s 1993 merger with powersoft resulted in its losing its focus on its core database technology in 1993 sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the windows operating system to microsoft corporation which markets it under the name sql server in 1994 informix overtook sybase and became oracle s most important rival the intense war between informix ceo phil white and ellison made front page news in silicon valley for three years informix claimed that oracle had hired away informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product informix finally dropped its lawsuit against oracle in 1997 in november 2005 a book

informix software s ceo phil white landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking ellison once it had overcome informix and sybase oracle corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the

oracle corporation and the german company sap ag had a decade long history of cooperation beginning with the integration of sap s sap r 3 r 3 enterprise application suite with oracle s relational

integration of sap applications with microsoft products such as microsoft sql server a competitor to oracle database oracle and sap continue their cooperation according to oracle corporation the majority of sap s customers use oracle databases in years however competition between oracle and sap has increased and as a result the rivalry between the two companies has grown even developing into a feud between the co founders of the two companies where one party would frequently voice strong negative comments about the other company in 2004 oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise applications market in 1989 oracle had already released oracle financials a series of acquisitions by oracle corporation began most notably those of peoplesoft siebel systems and hyperion solutions hyperion sap recognized that oracle had started to become a competitor in a market where sap had the leadership and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that oracle corporation had acquired sap would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications oracle corporation would resort to a similar strategy by advising sap customers to get off sap a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform oracle fusion for sap and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to sap customers who

made inappropriate downloads from the oracle support web site however it claims that sap personnel and sap customers had no access to oracle intellectual property via tomorrownow sap s ceo henning

40 nbsp million while oracle claimed that they are at least 1 65 nbsp billion the awarded amount is one of the 10 or 20 largest jury verdicts in u s legal history sap said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal on september 1 2011 a federal judge overturned the judgment and offered a reduced amount or a new trial calling oracle s original award grossly excessive oracle chose a
